# Random-Jokes-Generator
The Random Jokes Generator is a fun and interactive web application that displays a new joke every time a user clicks a button. It fetches jokes from a public joke API using JavaScript and dynamically updates the page without needing to reload it. The interface is clean, user-friendly, and responsive.
